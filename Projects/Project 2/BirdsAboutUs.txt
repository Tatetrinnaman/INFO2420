    <p><b>Location:</b> Salt Lake City</p>
    <p>Wow! The Birds of Utah calendar caught my attention with the great horned owl on the cover. I love watching raptors like hawks, eagles, vultures, and owls. Bart Jones' photography has inspired me to take out my 35mm camera and see what birds I can attract to my backyard. Looking forward to next year's calendar!</p>

    <p>Every Christmas, I search for the perfect calendar to gift my family. The Birds of Utah calendar was a hit, especially with my husband, who loves bird watching.

    <h2>Memories from Utah: Jeanette Findless</h2>
    <p><b>Location:</b> Orlando, Florida</p>
    <p>During our family visit to Utah, I found the Birds of Utah postcard book at the Salt Lake airport. The bird varieties in Utah are breathtaking, even more exotic than those in Florida. My son loved the big birds like owls and eagles. Thank you for creating a way to share these beautiful photos with our friends!</p>
